# MagicBricks Call Analysis Implementation

## Overview
Updated the Call QA Analyzer from iDreamCareer use case to MagicBricks property search use case with focus on critical steps completion and call objective achievement.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Use Case Transition
- **From**: iDreamCareer career counseling conversation flow
- **To**: MagicBricks property search and agent connection flow
- Removed all career counseling related patterns and steps
- Implemented property search conversation patterns

### 2. Critical Steps Definition
As per requirements, the critical steps for call objective completion are:
- **Primary Flow**: Steps 1, 6, 7, 9, 10
- **Alternative Flow**: Steps 1, 2, 6, 7, 9, 10 (including third-party interaction)

### 3. Conversation Steps Mapping

#### Critical Steps (Must Complete for Objective)
1. **Step 1**: Initial Greeting - MagicBricks introduction
2. **Step 6**: Interest Check & Property Confirmation - Verify customer requirements
3. **Step 7**: Agent Connection Offer - Offer to connect with agents
4. **Step 9**: Call Transfer - Execute agent connection
5. **Step 10**: Call Ending - Proper call closure

#### Optional/Conditional Steps
- **Step 2**: Third Party Interaction (if someone else answers)
- **Step 3**: Busy Response (if customer is busy)
- **Step 4**: Connection Failure (if technical issues)
- **Step 5**: Callback Scheduling (if callback needed)
- **Step 8**: Agent Decline Handling (if customer declines)
- **Step 11**: Voicemail Response (if voicemail)
- **Step 12**: Wrong Number Handling (if wrong number)
- **Step 13**: Goodbye (final closure)

### 4. Enhanced Hallucination Detection

#### Script Adherence Analysis
- **Mandatory Phrases**: Checks for required MagicBricks script phrases
- **Prohibited Phrases**: Detects script violations (e.g., "How can I help you?")
- **BHK Pronunciation**: Ensures "BHK" is pronounced as "Bee-etch-kay"
- **Number Spelling**: Verifies monetary amounts and property numbers are spelled out

#### New Hallucination Types
- **Script Deviation**: Bot deviated from prescribed MagicBricks script
- **Improper Objection Handling**: Failed to handle customer objections per FAQ
- **Topic Deviation**: Went off-topic from property search
- **Context Loss**: Lost conversational context
- **Semantic Confusion**: Unclear or confusing responses
- **Factual Error**: Inconsistent or incorrect information

### 5. Objection Handling Analysis
Analyzes bot responses against 58+ predefined objection scenarios including:
- Agent call frequency concerns
- Service cost questions
- Research phase responses
- Property search denials
- NRI-specific requirements
- And many more...

### 6. Conversation Context Types

#### Successful Scenarios (Objective Achieved)
- **Successful Property Inquiry**: Primary flow completed (1→6→7→9→10)
- **Alternative Successful Flow**: Via third party (1→2→6→7→9→10)

#### Future Completion Scenarios
- **Callback Scheduled**: Customer busy, callback arranged
- **Voicemail Left**: Message left for future contact

#### Failed Scenarios (Objective Not Achieved)
- **Failed Property Inquiry**: Customer declined agent connection
- **Wrong Number**: Incorrect contact information

### 7. Call Objective Analysis

#### Objective Achievement Criteria
- **Primary**: Complete steps 1, 6, 7, 9, 10
- **Alternative**: Complete steps 1, 2, 6, 7, 9, 10
- **Callback/Voicemail**: Acceptable for future objective completion

#### Analysis Output
```javascript
{
    objectiveAchieved: boolean,
    primaryObjectiveComplete: boolean,
    alternativeObjectiveComplete: boolean,
    completedCriticalSteps: number[],
    totalCriticalSteps: number,
    missingCriticalSteps: number[],
    completionRate: number (0-1)
}
```

### 8. Audio-First Analysis Priority
Maintained the audio-first approach for:
- **Silence Detection**: Precise timing from audio
- **Response Latency**: Actual audio timestamps
- **Hallucination Detection**: Speech patterns + script adherence
- **Interruption Handling**: Audio overlap detection

### 9. Enhanced Logging
Added comprehensive logging for:
- Call objective achievement status
- Critical steps completion tracking
- Script adherence violations
- Objection handling effectiveness

## Expected Audio Data Structure

```javascript
audioData = {
    duration: 180,
    turnTimings: [
        {
            speaker: 'agent'|'customer',
            startTime: 12.5,
            endTime: 18.2,
            turnIndex: 1
        }
    ],
    speechAnalysis: [
        {
            turnIndex: 1,
            confidence: 0.85,
            hesitationCount: 2,
            wordsPerMinute: 150,
            toneConsistency: 0.8
        }
    ],
    interruptionData: [...],
    silences: [...]
}
```

## Analysis Results Structure

```javascript
{
    // Existing metrics
    overallScore: number,
    silenceViolations: array,
    repetitions: array,
    intentFlow: {
        // Enhanced with MagicBricks-specific analysis
        callObjective: {
            objectiveAchieved: boolean,
            completionRate: number,
            criticalStepsAnalysis: object
        },
        objectiveAchieved: boolean,
        criticalStepsAnalysis: object
    },
    hallucinationAnalysis: {
        // Enhanced with script adherence
        scriptAdherence: number,
        objectionHandling: number
    },
    
    // New MagicBricks-specific metadata
    magicBricksAnalysis: {
        useCase: 'MagicBricks Property Search',
        criticalSteps: [1, 6, 7, 9, 10],
        alternativeCriticalSteps: [1, 2, 6, 7, 9, 10],
        objectiveAchieved: boolean,
        scriptAdherence: 'Analyzed for MagicBricks script compliance',
        objectionHandling: 'Analyzed against MagicBricks FAQ responses'
    }
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Objective-Focused Analysis**: Clear determination of call success based on critical steps
2. **Script Compliance**: Ensures bot follows MagicBricks prescribed dialogue
3. **Objection Handling**: Validates proper customer concern resolution
4. **Audio-First Accuracy**: Maintains precise timing analysis from audio data
5. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Handles all conversation scenarios (success, callback, voicemail, wrong number)

## Usage Notes

- The system prioritizes call objective achievement over conversation length
- Callback and voicemail scenarios are considered acceptable for future objective completion
- Script adherence is strictly monitored with specific penalties for violations
- Objection handling is analyzed against the comprehensive FAQ database
- All existing audio-first analysis capabilities are preserved and enhanced
